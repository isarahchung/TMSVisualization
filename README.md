# TMSVisualization for the Magic Leap 2 
Improving TMS (non-invasive brain stimulation treatment for depression) targeting during procedure.

The IMMERS Lab developed a Magic Leap 2 application designed to deliver real-time visual feedback to practitioners while performing the TMS procedure.  This   tool   is   designed   to   guide   them   in optimizing the coil’s position and angle for improved targeting and reduced cognitive load.
